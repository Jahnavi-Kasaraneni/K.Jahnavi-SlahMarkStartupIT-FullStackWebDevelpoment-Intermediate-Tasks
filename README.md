Task 1 : Link Shortener

In this project, you will be required to make an API to build short URLs. The functionality will be similar to bitly. Using Node, Express, and MongoDB you can make your own URL Shortener service. However, you can use any backend language also depending on your expertise. The project is not specific to any particular backend language.

Task 2: Online Code Editor 

Creating an online code editor running in browsers offers complete IDE functionalities, and it's a valuable skill-building project. It can potentially lead to a startup as a free interviewing platform. This project involves two main components: Backend API: This server-side component takes code and language as input and provides the output after executing the code on the server. Frontend Editor: On the frontend, you can choose a language, edit and modify the code. After editing, you make a post request to the backend API and display the output on the website.
